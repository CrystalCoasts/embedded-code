# embedded-code
For SD1 in idea of proof of concept we will make use of FIU network alongside Google API for transmitting data from sensors to web application


# future development
During SD2 we will change the system to use either Bluetoorh, or LoRa or similar communication that do not depend on internet Access.
In this scenario the idea is user connects to system using bluetooth, receives the data in sends it to have global access.
